## Design

Connascence as a software design metric (2011.02.11)
  https://practicingruby.com/articles/53

  This article summarizes and expands upon various 
  ideas from a talk given by Jim Weirich in 2009 on 
  "The Building Blocks of Modularity". The concept of 
  connascence gives us a powerful measure for discussing
  various kinds of coupling in our code, and how to go 
  about reducing it.

  The concept of connascence is one that has been
  underappreciated for far too long, so it's worth
  bringing it back up again every couple years!

Temporal coupling and the Law of Demeter (2012.08.19)
  https://practicingruby.com/articles/71

  This article explores a unique interpretation of the
  classic "Law of Demeter" by David Smyth that was critical 
  to the design and implementation of the software that 
  is used to communicate with NASA's Mars Rovers. 
  
  I built a fun little simulator to demonstrate some of the
  ideas in practice, but the main ideas are about reducing
  temporal coupling, increasing robustness, and making
  code more understandable.

An adventure in prototypes (2012.12.11)
  https://practicingruby.com/articles/95

  Written by Avdi Grimm, this article takes a weird and 
  wonderful journey through Ruby's metaprogramming 
  features to produce a full-blown prototype-oriented 
  object model that illustrates that the concept of
  "object-oriented programming" doesn't necessarily need
  to include classes or modules.

  Rather than beating you over the head with theory,
  Avdi incrementally builds up his prototype-based
  system while simultaneously piecing together a 
  text-based adventure game. This approach leads to 
  what is admittedly one of the most surreal articles 
  we've run in Practicing Ruby, but it's a fun one!
