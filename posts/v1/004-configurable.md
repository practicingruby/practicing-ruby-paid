In [Issue #3](http://practicingruby.com/articles/31), we discussed the numerous downsides of mixing configuration code with application code. We then went on to discuss how using YAML files can eliminate many of those problems. But since nothing is perfect, we're back again today to discuss some of the downsides of YAML based configurations as well as some alternative approaches that have their own ups and downs. We'll also touch on some practices that should be followed regardless of how you implement your configuration systems.

### Dynamic Configuration

Practicing Ruby reader Franklin Webber responded to some of the questions posed in Issue #3. In particular, he shared an example of YAML's aliasing functionality which allows you to reduce duplication in your configuration files.

```
default: &DEFAULT
  host:
    name: testsystem
    http_port: '8080'
    username: defaultuser
  database:
    host: db01/db01
    username:
    password:
  test:
    browser: FIREFOX

windows_default: &WIN_DEFAULT
  <<: *DEFAULT
  test:
    browser: IE
```

In this example, the `default` and `windows_default` configurations share almost the same attributes, except that browsers differ in test mode. Franklin uses aliasing to essentially perform a hash merge on the fly in the code above, solving his duplication problem. This is a neat way to keep your YAML configurations well organized.

But after sharing this trick, Franklin shows something that can't be done directly in YAML which illustrates where the data format breaks down. While it is possible to reference different points in the data structure, it's not possible to manipulate them, so the following concatenation example cannot work without modification:

```
host:
  name: localhost
  port: 3000
web:
  login_url: #{name}:#{port}/login 
```

Despite how simple this all seems, it is here that we cross the line from problems solved by a data format to those solved by programming languages. Franklin suggests that it would be possible to eval the strings to reach his goals, and Rails does almost the same thing by processing its YAML files through ERB. But once we start going down that road, we need to ask ourselves what it would take to just implement the entire configuration in pure Ruby. As you can see by the code below, the answer is 'not much'.

```ruby
module MyApp
  module Config
    HOST = { :name => 'localhost', :port => 3000 }
    WEB  = { :login_url =>  "#{HOST[:name]}:#{HOST[:port]}/login" }
  end
end
```

If we drop this snippet directly into our application code, we run into all the problems that our first example had in Issue #3. But by simply breaking this module out into its own file and requiring that file, those issues are avoided.

```ruby
require "config/my_app_config"
require "rest_client"

module MyApp
  module Client
    extend self

    def authenticate(user, password)
      RestClient.post(MyApp::Config::WEB[:login_url], 
        :user => user, :password => password)
    end
  end
end

MyApp::Client.authenticate('my_user', 'seekrit')
```

Using ordinary Ruby constants is no more complicated than referring to data stored in a YAML file, but gives you the full power of Ruby in your configuration scripts. In more complex configurations, you may even end up writing a mini-DSL, as shown in the `AccessControl` code below.

```ruby
AccessControl.configure do
  role "basic", 
    :permissions => [:read_answers, :answer_questions]
  
  role "premium", 
    :parent      => "basic",
    :permissions => [:hide_advertisements]

  role "manager", 
    :parent      => "premium",
    :permissions => [:create_quizzes, :edit_quizzes]

  role "owner",
    :parent      => "manager",
    :permissions => [:edit_users, :deactivate_users]
end
```

While this looks like vanilla configuration code on the surface, we can see that what we're actually working with are full blown Ruby objects. Here are some examples of how this system is used:

```ruby
>> AccessControl.roles_with_permission(:create_quizzes)
=> ["manager", "owner"]
>> AccessControl["premium"].permissions
=> [:hide_advertisements, :read_answers, :answer_questions]
>> AccessControl["owner"].allows?(:edit_users)
=> true
>> AccessControl["basic"].allows?(:edit_users)
=> false
```

This is an advanced configuration system that not only encapsulates some configuration data, but also makes it possible to query that data in useful ways. The following implementation code illustrates how little magic is involved in building such a system.

```ruby
module AccessControl
  extend self
 
  def configure(&block)
    instance_eval(&block)
  end

  def definitions
    @definitions ||= Hash.new
  end

  def role(level, options={})  
    definitions[level] = Role.new(level, options)
  end

  def roles_with_permission(permission)
    definitions.select { |k,v| v.allows?(permission) }.map { |k,_| k }
  end

  def [](level)
    definitions[level]
  end

  class Role
    def initialize(name, options)
      @name        = name
      @permissions = options[:permissions]
      @parent      = options[:parent]
    end

    attr_reader :parent

    def permissions
      return @permissions unless parent
      
      @permissions + AccessControl[parent].permissions
    end

    def allows?(permission)
      permissions.include?(permission)
    end
    
    def to_s
      @name
    end
  end
end
```

Because doing configuration in pure Ruby is so easy, I often lean towards it rather than using YAML or some other external file format. I find configuration files written in Ruby to be just as readable as YAML, but far more flexible.

There are some situations in which external data formats make more sense than Ruby based configurations. Using YAML might be a better idea than the approach shown above if any of the following apply to your application:

 * You need to integrate with other programs that will either read or write your configuration files. It is easier for a program written in another language to produce and consume YAML than it is for it to work with arbitrary Ruby code

 * You don't want users to be able to execute arbitrary code in your application's runtime environment. This can either be for security reasons, or for protecting users from their own stupidity by restricting the range of possible mistakes they can make.

 * You want configuration data that can easily be passed over a network and then executed remotely.

While these are all good reasons to avoid Ruby based configurations, frankly they are not common scenarios. The reason Ruby has had such a widespread adoption of YAML is almost certainly not because of it being the best tool for the job, but instead due to an early design decision made in Rails that people have emulated in their own projects without further thought. While either technique may get the job done, I'd argue that Ruby based configurations are a better default choice due to their inherent flexibility.

But sometimes, neither Ruby nor YAML does what we need them to do. In certain situations, configuration data isn't made available until the application is invoked. For those scenarios, we can take advantage of how well Ruby is integrated with the shell by making use of environment variables.

### Using the Shell Environment for Configuration

Every Ruby application has a fairly primitive but useful configuration system built into it through direct access to shell environment variables. As you can see in the code below, Ruby provides a top level constant that turns the environment variable mappings into a plain old Hash object.

```
$ TURBINE_API_KEY="saf3t33553" ruby -e "puts ENV['TURBINE_API_KEY']"
IqxPfasfasasfasfgqNm
```

The fact that I mention API keys in the above contrived example is no coincidence. The area I first made use of environment variables in my own applications was in a command line application which acted as a client to a web service I needed to interact with. Each distinct user needed to use a different API key, but I didn't want to rely on fragile home directory lookup code to provide per-user configuration. By using environment variables, it was possible to write a line like the following in my <i>.bash_profile</i> which would ensure that this information was available whenever my command line program ran.

```
export TURBINE_API_KEY="IqxPfasfasasfasfgqNm"
```

Since most modern shell implementations support environment variables, they're a good choice for this sort of semi-global configuration data. You'll also find environment variables used in places where you don't have much control over the system where your application is destined to run. The Ruby web application deployment service Heroku is a good example of that sort of environment.

On Heroku, you aren't given direct shell access and aren't even given any guarantees about where on the filesystem your application is destined to run. On top of that, if you want to run an open source application on Heroku while actively mirroring your changes to Github or some other public git host, you can't simply check in configuration files which may contain sensitive information, whether written in Ruby, YAML, or anything else.

The way Heroku solves these problems is with a configuration system based on, you guessed it, environment variables. The following example from the Heroku website shows how these set via the heroku command line app.

```
$ cd myapp
$ heroku config:add S3_KEY=8N029N81 S3_SECRET=9s83109d3+583493190
Adding config vars:
  S3_KEY    => 8N029N81
  S3_SECRET => 9s83109d3+583493190
Restarting app...done.
```

In the application code, we see the variables accessed in a similar fashion to our previous example.

```ruby
AWS::S3::Base.establish_connection!(
  :access_key_id     => ENV['S3_KEY'],
  :secret_access_key => ENV['S3_SECRET']
)
```

While hardly the first tool you should reach for, environment variables make sense in situations in which you do not want to store sensitive information within your application. They also come in handy when you don't want to assume anything about your user's file system in order to locate user-wide configuration settings.

Before we wrap up with some general tips that are relevant to all configurable applications, I'd like to quickly visit one more trick that involves project-wide configurations.

### Per-project configurations for command line apps

Some command line applications need to be context aware in order to do their jobs. Two such examples are rake and git. Both tools know how to locate their own configuration information so that they do the right thing when running their commands.

For example, git knows which repository to interact with because it knows how to work backwards to find the <i>.git/</i> configuration folder at the project root. Likewise, running `rake test` from anywhere within your project causes rake to look backwards recursively until it finds the nearest <i>Rakefile</i> to run. This general pattern can be seen in many other applications, and is worth knowing about in case you ever need to make use of it yourself.

While I don't want to go into much detail about this topic, I will say that it seemed a bit magical to me until I needed to implement this sort of functionality in my own projects. The basic idea is no more complicated than working backwards from your current directory until you find the file or folder than you need to interact with, which is something Ruby's pathname library can make quick work of.

Here's an example pulled directly out of a project of mine which illustrates a reverse search from the current working directory back to the filesystem's root directory.

```ruby
require 'pathname'

def config_dir(dir = Pathname.new("."))
  app_config_dir = dir + ".myappconfigfolder"
  if dir.children.include?(app_config_dir)
    app_config_dir.expand_path
  else
    return nil if dir.expand_path.root?
    config_dir(dir.parent)
  end
end
```

A bit of code like this combined with ordinary `require` calls for Ruby configurations or `YAML.load_file` calls for YAML configurations can be used to implement exactly the sort of context sensitive behavior you find in rake and git. I'll leave the exact methods of doing that as something for you to explore on your own, but hopefully this bit of code will come in handy if you ever run into that sort of situation.

This article turned out to be longer than I expected it to be, but hopefully was still quite useful to you. Before we part, let's review a few key points to keep in mind when building any sort of configuration system.

### Configuration Best Practices 

* Convention often is better than configuration. Always provide sensible defaults where possible. For example, if you're interacting with a service that has a common default port, don't force the user to define a port to use unless they wish to deviate from the default.

* Don't put your real configuration files into your application's code repository, since this can expose sensitive data and also makes it hard for others to submit patches without merge conflicts on configuration settings.

* Include a sample configuration file filled with reasonable defaults with your application. For example, in Rails, people often check in a <i>config/database.yml.example</i> for this purpose. The goal should be to make it as easy for your user to make a copy of the sample file and then customize it as needed to get their systems up and running

* Raise an appropriate error message when a config file is missing. You can do this by doing a `File.exist?` check before loading your configuration file, or by rescuing the error a failed load causes and then re-raising a more specific error that instructs the user on where to set up their configuration file.

* Make it as easy as possible for users to override defaults by merging their overrides rather than forcing them to replace whole configuration structures in order to make a small change.
