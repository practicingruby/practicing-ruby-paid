Test-driven development (TDD) is a topic that never gets old among programmers, 
even though we can hardly agree on what its costs and benefits are. While 
there are no shortage of neatly packaged expert viewpoints on this topic,
very few of them are backed up by solid evidence. Formal research
indicates that TDD does tend to produce code with fewer defects, but no other
significant effects have been found. What these results tell us is that the
burden of proof is on us for everything else we believe about TDD, especially 
when it comes to perceived benefits that have nothing to do with 
regression testing.

Thinking about my own relationship to test-driven development, I came to
realize that my own assumptions about its costs and benefits were 
fuzzy at best. I had plenty of opinions on the topic, but found it hard to 
elaborate on them. As these opinions hardened into beliefs, it became 
much more challenging to meaningfully consider ideas about TDD which
differed from my own. My own cynicism was preventing me from making 
a reasoned argument for my way of doing things. 

Knowing that stubbornness is the enemy of progress, I decided to take 
a fresh look at my use of TDD and how it effects my work. For a period
of 90 days, I challenged myself to practice formal TDD as often as 
possible, and to learn as much about 
it as I could during that time. While the [original plans for my self
study](http://practicingruby.com/articles/28) were much more
rigorous than what I ended up doing, I did maintain a fairly
disciplined TDD workflow throughout the three month period, and that
taught me a few lessons worth sharing.

To make it easier for us to discuss what I've learned, I've decided to 
break the lessons out into individual mini-articles, each with their own comments
thread. Please follow the links below to read them:

* [LESSON 1: End-to-end testing is essential](http://practicingruby.com/articles/66)
* [LESSON 2: Refactoring is not redesign](http://practicingruby.com/articles/67)
* [LESSON 3: Mock objects deeply influence design](http://practicingruby.com/articles/68)
* [LESSON 4: Spiking is not cowboy coding](http://practicingruby.com/articles/69)

If you feel there are other lessons that you have learned from your own work
with TDD, or you have general questions about how my self-study went, feel free
to share them here.
