### LESSON 5: Disciplined TDD comes at a high cost

(consider cutting)

Evo + Capybara
Blind / TicTacToe + Ray

Harder to evaluate statement:

- What are the costs of NOT doing TDD, or only doing a little TDD?
(some evidence that they're quite real and problematic)

- What are the benefits of TDD?

## Reflections

I have identified some of the things that get in the way of me experiencing the
benefits of TDD, but I haven't quite figured out how to fix those problems.
Also, the sheer time investment is something that's hard to ignore, feels like a
bit of a gamble. However, I think its fair enough to keep studying, at least
until I feel like I know where the boundaries are.
