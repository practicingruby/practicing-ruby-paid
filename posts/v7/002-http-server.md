Implementing a simpler version of a technology that you use every day can 
help you understand it better. In this article, we will apply this
technique by building a simple HTTP server in Ruby. 

By the time you're done reading, you will know how to serve files from your 
computer to a web browser with no dependencies other than a few standard
libraries that ship with Ruby. Although the server 
we build will not be robust or anywhere near feature complete,
it will allow you to look under the hood of one of the most fundamental 
pieces of technology that we all use on a regular basis.

## A (very) brief introduction to HTTP

We all use web applications on a daily basis and many of us build
them for a living, but much of our work is done far above the HTTP level. This
is a good thing when it comes to writing web applications, but when it comes to
building a web server, we're going to need to come down from the clouds a little
bit. 

What we need to understand is what actually happens at the protocol
level when someone clicks a link to `http://example.com/file.txt` in their
web browser. The following steps roughly outline that process:

1) The browser issues an HTTP request by opening a TCP socket connection to
`example.com` on port 80. The server accepts the connection and opens another
socket for bi-directional communication.

2) Once the connection has been made, the HTTP client sends the request over the
connection:

```
GET /file.txt HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: ExampleBrowser/1.0
Host: example.com
Accept: */*
```
    
3) The server then parses the request. The first line is the Request-Line which contains
the HTTP method (`GET`), Request-URI (`/file.txt`), and HTTP version (`1.1`).
Subsequent lines are headers, key-value pairs delimited by ":". After the
headers is a blank line followed by an optional message body (not used in
this example).

4) Using the same connection, the server responds with the contents of the file:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 11

hello world
```

5) Finally, the server closes the socket after finishing the response to 
terminate the connection.

Using this basic workflow as a guide, we can start writing some code!

## Writing the "Hello World" HTTP server

To begin, let's build the simplest thing that could possibly work: a web server
that always responds "Hello World" with HTTP 200 to any request. The following
code mostly follows the process outlined in the previous section, but is
commented line-by-line to help you understand its implementation details:

```ruby
require 'socket' # Provides TCPServer and TCPSocket classes

# Initialize a TCPServer object that will listen 
# on localhost:2345 for incoming connections.
server = TCPServer.new('localhost', 2345)
 
# loop infinitately, processing one incoming 
# connection at a time. 
loop do

  # Wait until a client connects, then return a TCPSocket
  # that can be used in a similar fashion to other Ruby
  # I/O objects. (In fact, TCPSocket is a subclass of IO)
  socket = server.accept
  
  # Read the first line of the request (the Request-Line)
  request = socket.gets

  # Log the request to the console for debugging
  STDERR.puts request

  response = "Hello World!\n"

  # We need to include the Content-Type and Content-Length headers
  # to let the client know the size and type of data 
  # contained in the response. Note that HTTP is whitespace
  # sensitive, and expects each header line to end with CRLF (i.e. "\r\n")
  socket.print "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n" +
               "Content-Type: text/plain\r\n" +
               "Content-Length: #{response.size}\r\n" 
               
  # Print a blank line to separate the header from the response body,
  # as required by the protocol.             
  socket.print "\r\n"
          
  # Print the actual response body, which is just "Hello World!\n"     
  socket.print response
  
  # Close the socket, terminating the connection
  socket.close
end
```
To test your server, run this code and then try opening `http://localhost:2345/anything` 
in a browser. You should see the "Hello world!" message. Meanwhile, in the output for
the HTTP server, you should see the request being logged:

```
GET /anything HTTP/1.1
```
   
Next, open another shell and test it with `curl`:

```
curl --verbose -XGET http://localhost:2345/anything
```
    
You'll see the detailed request and response headers:

```
* About to connect() to localhost port 2345 (#0)
*   Trying 127.0.0.1... connected
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 2345 (#0)
> GET /anything HTTP/1.1
> User-Agent: curl/7.19.7 (universal-apple-darwin10.0) libcurl/7.19.7 
              OpenSSL/0.9.8r zlib/1.2.3
> Host: localhost:2345
> Accept: */*
> 
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Content-Type: text/plain
< Content-Length: 13
< 
Hello world!
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
* Closing connection #0
```

Congratulations, you've written a simple HTTP server! Now we'll build a more useful one.

## Serving files over HTTP

We're about to build a more realistic program that is capable of serving files over HTTP, 
rather than simply responding to any request with "Hello World". In order to do that, we'll need
to make a few changes to the way our server works.

For each incoming request, we'll parse the `Request-URI` header and translate it into 
a path to a file within the server's public folder. If we're able to find a match, we'll 
respond with its contents, using the file's size to determine the `Content-Length`, 
and its extension to determine the `Content-Type`. If no matching file can be found, 
we'll respond with a `404 Not Found` error status.

Most of these changes are fairly straightforward to implement, but mapping the 
`Request-URI` to a path on the server's filesystem is a bit more complicated due 
to security issues. To simplify things a bit, let's assume for the moment that a 
`requested_file` function has been implemented for us already that can handle
this task safely. Then we could build a rudimentary HTTP file server in the following way:

```ruby
require 'socket'
require 'uri'

# Files will be served from this directory
WEB_ROOT = './public'

# Map extensions to their content type
CONTENT_TYPE_MAPPING = {
  'html' => 'text/html',
  'txt' => 'text/plain',
  'png' => 'image/png',
  'jpg' => 'image/jpeg'
}

# Treat as binary data if content type cannot be found
DEFAULT_CONTENT_TYPE = 'application/octet-stream'

# This helper function parses the extension of the
# requested file and then looks up its content type.

def content_type(path)
  ext = File.extname(path).split(".").last
  CONTENT_TYPE_MAPPING.fetch(ext, DEFAULT_CONTENT_TYPE)
end

# This helper function parses the Request-Line and
# generates a path to a file on the server.

def requested_file(request_line)
  # ... implementation details to be discussed later ...
end

# Except where noted below, the general approach of
# handling requests and generating responses is
# similar to that of the "Hello World" example
# shown earlier.

server = TCPServer.new('localhost', 2345)

loop do
  socket       = server.accept
  request_line = socket.gets

  STDERR.puts request_line

  path = requested_file(request_line)

  # Make sure the file exists and is not a directory
  # before attempting to open it.
  if File.exist?(path) && !File.directory?(path)
    File.open(path) do |file|
      socket.print "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n" +
                   "Content-Type: #{content_type(file)}\r\n" +
                   "Content-Length: #{file.size}\r\n"
                 
      socket.print "\r\n"
    
      # print the contents of the file to the socket, line by line.
      file.each { |line| socket.print line }
    end
  else 
    message = "File not found\n"
    
    # respond with a 404 error code to indicate the file does not exist
    socket.print "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\r\n" +
                 "Content-Type: text/plain\r\n" +
                 "Content-Length: #{message.size}\r\n"
                 
    socket.print "\r\n"
    
    socket.print message
  end

  socket.close
end
```

Although there is a lot more code here than what we saw in the 
"Hello World" example, most of it is routine file manipulation
similar to the kind we'd encounter in everyday code. Now there 
is only one more feature left to implement before we can serve 
files over HTTP: the `requested_file` method.

## Safely converting a URI into a file path

Practically speaking, mapping the Request-Line to a file on the server's filesystem is easy: you extract the Request-URI, scrub out any parameters and URI-encoding, and then finally turn that into a path to a file in the server's public folder:

```ruby
# Takes a request line (e.g. "GET /path?foo=bar HTTP/1.1")
# and extracts the path from it, scrubbing out parameters
# and unescaping URI-encoding. 
#
# This cleaned up path (e.g. "/path") is then converted into 
# a relative path to a file in the server's public folder 
# by joining it with the WEB_ROOT.
def requested_file(request_line)
  request_uri  = request_line.split(" ")[1]
  path         = URI.unescape(URI(request_uri).path)

  File.join(WEB_ROOT, path)
end
```

However, this implementation has a very bad security problem that has affected
many, many web servers and CGI scripts over the years: the server will happily
serve up any file, even if it's outside the `WEB_ROOT`.

Consider a request like this:

```
GET /../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
```   

On my system, when `File.join` is called on this path, the ".." path components
will cause it escape the `WEB_ROOT` directory and serve the `/etc/passwd` file.
Yikes! We'll need to sanitize the path before use in order to prevent problems 
like this. 

> **Note:** If you want to try to reproduce this issue on your own machine, 
you may need to use a low level too like *curl* to demonstrate it. Some browsers 
change the path to remove the ".." before sending a request to the server.

Because security code is notoriously difficult to get right, we will borrow our
implementation from [Rack::File](https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/master/lib/rack/file.rb).
The approach shown below was actually added to `Rack::File` in response to a [similar 
security vulnerability](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-0262) that 
was disclosed in early 2013:

```ruby
def requested_file(request_line)
  request_uri  = request_line.split(" ")[1]
  path         = URI.unescape(URI(request_uri).path)
  
  clean = []

  # Split the path into components
  parts = path.split("/")

  parts.each do |part|
    # skip any empty or current directory (".") path components
    next if part.empty? || part == '.'
    # If the path component goes up one directory level (".."), 
    # remove the last clean component.
    # Otherwise, add the component to the Array of clean components
    part == '..' ? clean.pop : clean << part
  end

  # return the web root joined to the clean path 
  File.join(WEB_ROOT, *clean)
end
```

To test this implementation (and finally see your file server in action), replace the `requested_file` stub in the example from the previous section with the implementation shown above, and then create an `index.html` file in a `public/` folder that is contained within the same directory as your server script. Upon running the script, you should be able to visit `http://localhost:2345/index.html` but NOT be able to reach any files outside of the `public/` folder.

## Serving up index.html implicitly

If you visit `http://localhost:2345` in your web browser, you'll see a 404 Not
Found response, even though you've created an index.html file. Most real web
servers will serve an index file when the client requests a directory. Let's
implement that.

This change is more simple than it seems, and can be accomplished by adding
a single line of code to our server script:

```diff
# ...
path = requested_file(request_line)

+ path = File.join(path, 'index.html') if File.directory?(path)

if File.exist?(path) && !File.directory?(path)
  file = File.new(path)
# ...
```

Doing so will cause any path that refers to a directory to have "/index.html" appended to 
the end of it. This way, `/` becomes `/index.html`, and `/path/to/dir` becomes 
`path/to/dir/index.html`.

Perhaps surprisingly, the validations in our response code do not need
to be changed. Let's recall what they look like and then examine why
that's the case:

```ruby
if File.exist?(path) && !File.directory?(path)
  # serve up the file...
else
  # respond with a 404
end
```

Suppose a request is received for `/somedir`. That request will automatically be converted by our server into `/somedir/index.html`. If the index.html exists within `/somedir`, then it will be served up without any problems. However, if `/somedir` does not contain an `index.html` file, the `File.exist?` check will fail, causing the server to respond with a 404 error code. This is exactly what we want!

It may be tempting to think that this small change would make it possible to remove the `File.directory?` check, and in normal circumstances you might be able to safely do with it. However, because leaving it in prevents an error condition in the edge case where someone attempts to serve up a directory named `index.html`, we've decided to leave that validation as it is.

With this small improvement, our file server is now pretty much working we'd expect it to. If you want to play with it some more, you can grab the [complete source code](https://github.com/elm-city-craftworks/practicing-ruby-examples/tree/master/v7/002) from Github.

## Where to go from here

In this article, we reviewed how HTTP works, then built a simple web
server that can serve up files from a directory. We've also examined 
one of the most common security problems with web applications and 
fixed it. If you've made it this far, congratulations! That's a lot
to learn in one day.

However, it's obvious that the server we've built is extremely limited. 
If you want to continue in your studies, here are a few recommendations
for how to go about improving the server:

* According to the HTTP 1.1, specification a server must minimally 
respond to GET and HEAD to be compliant. Implement the HEAD response.
* Add error handling that returns a 500 response to the client 
if something goes wrong with the request.
* Make the web root directory and port configurable.
* Add support for POST requests. You could implement CGI by executing 
a script when it matches the path, or implement the Rack spec to 
let the server serve Rack apps with `call`.

Please do share your experiences and code if you decide to try any of 
these ideas, or if you come up with some improvement ideas of your own. 
Happy hacking!
