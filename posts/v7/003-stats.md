1. individual days, relationship between mood and time of the day
patterns.
days break into 3 hours 8am to 11pm, 15 hours.
8-11, 11-2, 2-5, 5-8, 8-11.

2. work day or rest day, mood difference

3. the drag effect, if there is a number stands out background, find outlier (<3 or >8), take n (maybe 10) data points around it, average different from global average?

4. periods of time, mood alleviated or depressed for a couple days?
day average, the drag effect

5. cycles. FFT on day averages

Discuss that the data exploration method is scientific but the measured data is
not. If we switched to vital signs or spit test for hormone, could use
similar tests and get objective results (downside: narrow the scope,
because "mood" is a subjective concept).
