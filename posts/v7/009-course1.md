This self-guided course will help you learn how to work with the low level 
tools that you'd usually rely on libraries and frameworks to provide. 
Each of its four parts will give you a feel for a different kind 
of I/O programming and text processing work:

* Standard I/O streams and the filesystem
* Encoding and decoding binary files
* Parsing text-based file formats
* Socket programming and network I/O

In each part of the course, you'll start by carefully reading a Practicing Ruby 
article that explores one of the topics listed above. You will then work through 
a set of review questions to test your grasp of the material. Finally you'll 
apply the concepts to realistic problems by working on a set of project-based
exercises.

Once you've completed the entire study guide, you'll know how to do all of the
following things:

* Build command line applications in Ruby that follow the Unix philosophy and
work similarly to other console-based applications you use day to day.

* Encode and decode binary files at the level of bits and bytes, and understand
how primitive data structures are represented in low-level storage formats.

* Work with streams in a memory efficient way, whether they're coming from files, 
standard I/O, or the internet.

* Work with the same parser and compiler technology that is used by serious
text processing libraries and programming languages.

* Understand the basics behind TCP-level socket programming, and how to build
simple client and server software.

We often take these concepts for granted because our libraries and frameworks take
care of them for us. But this self-guided tour of Ruby's basement will help you
appreciate the many low-level tools and techniques we have 
available for solving these problems.

Work at your own pace, and don't hesitate to ask for help when you need it. You
can submit issues in our tracker for general questions, and pull requests when
you'd like a review of your work. Good luck, and happy hacking!
